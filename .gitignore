# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#   https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#commit-your-poetrylock-file-to-version-control
#poetry.lock

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#pdm.lock
#   pdm stores project-wide configurations in .pdm.toml, but it is recommended to not include it
#   in version control.

# IMPORTANT: Files that ARE tracked (not ignored)
# ============================================================================
# The following are intentionally tracked in Git:
# - TCLS/models/**/*.h5          (Trained neural network models)
# - TCLS/models/**/test/*.png    (Test result visualizations)
# - TCLS/models/**/test/*.txt    (Test result data)
# - TCLS/**/*.py                 (All Python source code)
# - TCLS/**/*.ini                (Configuration files)
# - TCLS/intersection/*.xml      (SUMO network & route files)
# - *.md                         (Documentation files)
# - Requirements.txt             (Python dependencies)
# - .vscode/                     (VS Code settings for consistency)
# ============================================================================

# PyCharm
#  JetBrains specific template is maintained in a separate JetBrains.gitignore that can
#  be found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Global/JetBrains.gitignore
#  and can be added to the global gitignore or merged into this file.  For a more nuclear
#  option (not recommended) you can uncomment the following to ignore the entire idea folder.
#.idea/
